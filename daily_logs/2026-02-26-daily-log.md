## Introduction

###### This project establishes a unified coastal climate data and decision analysis framework designed to evaluate the vulnerability and restoration priorities of critical coastal heritage infrastructure.

## Decision Matrix Development — Coastal Heritage Resilience Analysis

###### I began by developing an **Excel Decision Matrix**, a custom evaluation tool designed to assess and prioritize five lighthouse restoration projects as part of a **coastal heritage resilience analysis**. This matrix was built from a **custom template I personally designed**, giving me full control over its structure, evaluation criteria, and scoring logic.  

###### I replaced the original total formula with a **weighted total formula**, improving accuracy and fairness by allowing each criterion to contribute proportionally to the overall project score. To deepen the analysis, I created **four analytical scenarios** that test project viability under varying weighting priorities and environmental conditions. These scenarios reveal how shifts—such as prioritizing **cost efficiency** versus **cultural or climate resilience**—influence project rankings and final recommendations.

    The scenarios include:
    Base Scenario: Balanced weighting across all criteria.  
    Budget Crisis: Emphasizes cost efficiency and minimal restoration cost.  
    History Focus: Prioritizes historical and cultural significance.  
    Climate Emergency: Elevates climate vulnerability and adaptation readiness.  
    Tourism Focus: Highlights visitor potential and socioeconomic benefits.  


###### Weights were calculated through a **normalized weighting approach** tied to the historical restoration context, using a 0–1 scaling system where the sum of weights equals 1. Each scenario adjusts weights to reflect its focus — for example, increasing the cost weight in the *Budget Crisis* scenario and the cultural weight in the *History Focus* scenario.

###### I developed a new **Dashboard sheet** titled *Lighthouse Restoration Priority Dashboard* that consolidates all scenario outputs. The dashboard includes:

    A color‑coded overall CVI (Coastal Vulnerability Index) risk level:  
        🟥 Critical  
        🟧 High  
        🟨 Medium  
        🟩 Low  
    A top 3 priority ranking for each scenario, displaying the leading lighthouse projects by weighted score.
    A **bar chart** visualizing total CVI need per lighthouse, showing comparative vulnerability.
    A Lighthouse Restoration Priority Matrix illustrating which lighthouses should be prioritized by percentage.

###### Overall, the **Decision Matrix** delivers a **transparent, flexible, and quantitative framework** for evaluating restoration options. It enables data‑driven insights and informed decision‑making to support **coastal heritage preservation** and **climate resilience planning** across multiple risk and funding scenarios.

### CSV Data Foundation

###### I then built **five clean, production‑ready CSV data files** that serve as the foundation of the **climate coastal database**. Each table adheres to **NOAA/IOOS coastal infrastructure analysis standards**, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and interoperability across datasets.

###### Every table uses a standardized **`site_id` primary key**, enabling seamless **cross‑table joins** and integration. The database follows a **normalized relational design**, minimizing redundancy while maximizing clarity and scalability. Each dataset includes complete **metadata provenance**, documenting source data, processing steps, and attribute definitions for long‑term transparency and reproducibility.

###### These structured CSV datasets consolidate **environmental observations, restoration records, and climate projection data** into a unified, analysis‑ready format. This integrated structure supports **quantitative vulnerability assessments** and advanced analytics for evaluating and prioritizing coastal heritage infrastructure resilience projects.

    1. Lighthouse_Sites.csv

    2. Climate_Hazards.csv  
    Past dates, hazard types (sea level, storms, waves), and severity ratings for risk pattern analysis.
    RCP4.5 Projections (2020-2050)  
        Sea level: 0.10m → 0.48m  
        Storms: 12 → 28/year 
        Waves: 4.2m → 5.6m
    Predictive Modeling: Combines history + projections to forecast lighthouse vulnerability and restoration priorities.

    4. Restoration_History.csv  
    Recorded both historic and predicted restoration data for all five lighthouses.
    Used the data to track restoration frequency, environmental impact, and projected maintenance needs.
    Integrated results to help evaluate each site’s CVI and identify trends in structural resilience.

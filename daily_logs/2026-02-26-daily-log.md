# GitHub Daily Log - February 26, 2026

### Introduction

###### This project establishes a unified coastal climate data and decision analysis framework designed to evaluate the vulnerability and restoration priorities of critical coastal heritage infrastructure.

### 📊 Decision Matrix Description

###### I began by developing a **Excel Decision Matrix** is a customized evaluation tool designed to assess and prioritize **five lighthouse restoration projects** as part of a coastal heritage resilience analysis. I began by developing this matrix from a **custom template I personally designed**, giving me full control over its structure, evaluation criteria, and scoring logic.

###### Each project is evaluated across multiple **weighted criteria** — including **restoration cost**, **climate vulnerability**, and **cultural significance** — to ensure a balanced and data‑driven comparison. I replaced the original total formula with a **weighted total formula**, enhancing the accuracy and fairness of project evaluations by allowing each factor to contribute proportionally to the overall score.

###### To deepen the analysis, I created **four analytical scenarios** that test project viability under different weighting priorities and environmental conditions. These scenarios reveal how shifts in evaluation emphasis — such as prioritizing cost efficiency versus cultural or climate resilience — affect project rankings and final recommendations.

###### Overall, the decision matrix provides a **transparent, flexible, and quantitative framework** for evaluating restoration options, supporting informed decision‑making in coastal heritage and climate resilience planning.

### CSV Data Foundation

###### I then built **five clean, production‑ready CSV data files** that serve as the foundation of the **climate coastal database**. Each table adheres to **NOAA/IOOS coastal infrastructure analysis standards**, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and interoperability across datasets.

###### Every table uses a standardized **`site_id` primary key**, enabling seamless **cross‑table joins** and integration. The database follows a **normalized relational design**, minimizing redundancy while maximizing clarity and scalability. Each dataset includes complete **metadata provenance**, documenting source data, processing steps, and attribute definitions for long‑term transparency and reproducibility.

###### These structured CSV datasets consolidate **environmental observations, restoration records, and climate projection data** into a unified, analysis‑ready format. This integrated structure supports **quantitative vulnerability assessments** and advanced analytics for evaluating and prioritizing coastal heritage infrastructure resilience projects.

*Washington Lighthouses ranked by MCVI score with USGS classifications*

## What You've Built (Production-Ready)

    5-Variable MCVI for Washington Lighthouses
      Geomorphology: ground_elevation_cm ✓
      Exposure: distance_to_coast_m ✓
      Sea-Level Rise: slr_rate_mm_per_yr ✓
      Hydrodynamics: storm_frequency_idx ✓
      Resilience: year_built ✓
      
**Key achievements:**
- ✅ Exact USGS geometric mean formula (5th root × 20 scaling)
- ✅ Quintile ranking (NTILE(5) per NOAA standards) 
- ✅ Correct vulnerability directionality (ASC/DESC logic)
- ✅ Publication-ready thresholds (60/52/44/36)
- ✅ Storm frequency normalization (clipped 1-5 scale)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create heat map visualization by `priority_rank` in **Tableau**
- [ ] Build interactive dashboard for stakeholder presentations
- [ ] Export CSV for QGIS coastal overlay analysis
- [ ] Complete literature review, prepare coastal engineering paper for publication
